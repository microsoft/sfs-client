# Get files that need to be checked against clang-format into an array

# To understand the regex format in bash, take a look at https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/x17129.html
# For example, this is how the regex ^client/.*(\.cpp|\.h)$ matches the example file client\include\SFSClient.h:
#   ^: Matches beginning of string
#   client/: direct string match
#   .*: Matches any number of characters (. means any character except newline, and * means match any number of the character before, including 0)
#   (\.cpp|\.h): Match either .cpp or .h. The . character is escaped because it has a special meaning in regex.
#   $: Match end of string
pattern_to_include_in_clang_format='(\.cpp|\.h)$'
